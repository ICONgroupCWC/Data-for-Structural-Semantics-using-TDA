# Data for structural semantics using topological data analysis
- This dataset is designed to explore the advantages of utilizing topological summaries of raw data (an abstraction) rather than the raw data itself in machine learning applications.
- This dataset (Hand_Digits_Data) consits of $600$ raw data examples which are obtained from the MNIST handwritten digits dataset.
- Labels are .
