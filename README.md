# Data for structural semantics using topological data analysis
- This dataset is designed to explore the advantages of utilizing topological summaries of raw data (an abstraction) rather than the raw data itself in machine learning applications.
- This dataset (Hand_Digits_Data) consists of 600 raw data examples derived from the MNIST handwritten digits dataset.
- Labels are assciated with the $1$-dimenisonal holes associated with raw data.
