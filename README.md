# Data for structural semantics using topological data analysis
- This dataset is designed to explore the advantages of utilizing topological summaries of raw data (an abstraction) rather than the raw data itself in machine learning applications.
- This dataset consists ofÂ $600$ raw data examples derived from the MNIST handwritten digits dataset.
  `Hand_Digits_Data`
- The labels correspond to the $1$-dimensional holes that appeared in the raw data.
